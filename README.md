# Face_Recognition_classroom

A face recognition and face tracking project for measuring the duration of students' attendance in the classroom.    
The input of the project is a short video taken from our Computer Vision classroom.  
The output of the project is the same video with squares around students face displaying their names.    
The other output is the attendance time (in seconds) of each student. 
  
  
## Output  
**Attendence duration**: {'StudentID:1': 260, 'StudentID:2': 119, 'StudentID:3': 115, 'StudentID:4': 57,'StudentID:5': 117, 'StudentID:6': 141, 'StudentID:8': 11}  
  
**Students who are present at the classroom**:
['StudentID:1', 'StudentID:2', 'StudentID:3', 'StudentID:4', 'StudentID:5', 'StudentID:6', 'StudentID:8']
